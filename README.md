# Shoes app - React

This project was built with RecactJS.  
In this project I built a store app. I used:

- CRUD - The user can create, read, delete or update the different store items.
- I used axios library for API calls. I used different http requests: get, post, put, delete on a mocked API which I manually edit with details about each product.
- I used Router library for the different links paths.
